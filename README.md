This package separates each drone’s control into two ROS 2 nodes: a **Movement Execution Node** (not in this package), which connects to MAVLink (SITL or autopilot) and use functions like goto, movexyz, takeoff, land, RTH and RTL; and a **Collision Avoidance Filter Node**, which intercepts every command, wraps it in a `MovementExchange` request to all peers, and only forwards the original call to the Movement Execution Node when every drone replies `can_move=true`.

To run the system, first launch one or more ArduCopter SITL instances via `sim\_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f quad --instance 0 --sysid 1 --console --map --out=0.0.0.0:14551` in the Ardupilot repository. Then, in your ROS 2 workspace, build with `colcon build --symlink-install` and source `install/setup.bash`. For each drone, start the Movement Execution Node with `ros2 run ros2_library library_node <droneID>` and the Collision Avoidance Node with `ros2 run ros2_library collision_avoidance <droneID>`. Once both nodes are running for every drone, you can plan missions or send high‑level movement commands—these will be safely filtered and coordinated across the fleet by the Collision Avoidance layer.
